# Key Insights from Discount vs Profit Analysis (E-commerce Project)

This analysis explored the relationship between discount percentages and profit margins in an e-commerce setting. Using simulated discount rates on sample sales data, I aimed to identify which discount levels were most profitable.

### âœ… Key Insights:
1. **Low Discounts Lead to Higher Profit:**
   - Orders with **0% â€“ 10% discounts** resulted in the highest average profit margins across the dataset.
   
2. **Profit Decreases as Discount Increases:**
   - A clear downward trend was observed as discount percentages increased beyond 10%.
   - Discount bands between **20% â€“ 50%** showed significantly lower average profits.

3. **Business Takeaway:**
   - Offering minimal discounts (under 10%) tends to maximize profitability, based on this analysis.
   - Steep discounts reduce profit margins and should be carefully evaluated before implementation.

### ðŸ“Š Visualization:
The accompanying bar chart clearly shows the declining profit pattern across discount bands.
